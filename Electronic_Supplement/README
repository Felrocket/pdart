Table S1 Station Parameters

station_parameters.csv 

The file contains parameters describing the location of the Apollo seismometers:

Date of Deployment
Latitude (degrees) [1]
Longitude (degrees) [1]
Elevation of the station (meters) [2]
Azimuth of horizontal X component (in degrees) [3][a]
Azimuth of horizontal Y component (in degrees)[3][a]
Distance from the lunar module (meters) [3]
Location Name
Distance from Station 12 (km) [3]
Azimuth to Station 12 (degrees) [3]
Distance from Station 14 (km) [3]
Azimuth to Station 14 (degrees) [3]
Distance from Station 15 (km) [3]
Azimuth to Station 15 (degrees) [3]
Distance from Station 16 (km) [3]
Azimuth to Station 16 (degrees) [3]

[a] Upward ground motion produces positive-going output signal for the vertical
components. The listed azimuths for the horizontal component seismometers are
the directions of ground motion that give positive going output signal.

Table S2: Operational Status
Files are in pdart/OperationalStatus 
Describes various aspects of the operational status, including whether the instrument was in peaked or flat mode, whether the uplink/downlink was working correctly and whether the instrument was responding to leveling commands. The table was from Bates et al. (1979), and has been restructured to indicate problem duration. We added a code to indicate whether there was an error on the channel (0), when it returns to normal operation (1) or if the message could be interpreted as a warning (2).

Table S3: Command Files 
Files are in pdart/CalibrationFiles
The files contain the timing of commands sent to the Apollo stations. Cvtfp are from the PSE tapes and cptw from the work tapes (which were used near the end of the mission).

The following commands were used: 
 1 (51): gain change for MHX & MHY
 2 (52): gain change for MHZ
 3 (53): calibration on/off for SH
 4 (54): calibration on/off for MH
 5 (55): gain change for SHZ
 6 (56): leveling power X motor on/off
 7 (57): leveling power Y motor on/off
 8 (58): leveling power Z motor on/off
 9 (59): uncage arm/fire
10 (60): leveling direction plus/minus
11 (61): leveling speed low/high
12 (62): thermal control mode auto/manual
13 (65): feedback filter in/out
14 (66): coarse leveling sensor in/out
15 (67): leveling mode auto/manual

Figure S1 Example Calibration Pulse 

Calibration_pulse.png

The plot shows two example calibration pulses. Generally, a pulse was sent, followed by a pulse in the opposite direction a few minutes later. The example from 1970 was recorded during peak mode, and the example from 1976 in flat mode. Table S3 includes the timing of the calibration pulses.
